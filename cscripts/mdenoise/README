usage: Mdenoise -i input_file [options]
      -e         Common Edge Type of Face Neighbourhood (Default: Common Vertex)
      -t float   Threshold (0,1), Default value: 0.4
      -n int     Number of Iterations for Normal updating, Default value: 20
      -v int     Number of Iterations for Vertex updating, Default value: 50
      -o char[]  Output file
      -a         Adds edges and vertices to generate high-quality triangle mesh.
                 Only function when the input is .xyz file.
      -z         Only z-direction position is updated.
      
Supported input type: .gts, .obj, .off, .ply, .ply2, .smf, .stl, .wrl, .xyz, and .asc
Supported output type: .obj, .off, .ply, .ply2, .xyz, and .asc
Default file extension: .off

Examples:
Mdenoise -i cylinderN02.ply2
Mdenoise -i cylinderN02.ply2 -n 5 -o cylinderDN
Mdenoise -i cylinderN02.ply2 -t 0.8 -e -v 20 -o cylinderDN.obj
Mdenoise -i FandiskNI02-05 -o FandiskDN.ply
Mdenoise -i Terrain.xyz -o TerrainP -z -n 1
Mdenoise -i my_dem_utm.asc -o my_dem_utmP -n 4

Note: For the .asc file, the program always sets the switch -z on, whether you have 
put it on the command line or not. If there is a .prj file with the same name as the 
input .asc file, it is copied to a .prj file with the same name as the output .asc file. 

About the file formats:
All kinds of input files except for .xyz and .asc files have the standard format of
CAD or geometrical processing files. The .xyz and .asc files are primarily designed 
for dealing with geological data, where the .asc files have the standard ESRI ASCII Grid
format, and the .xyz files have the following format:
The first few lines (optional) are comment lines starting with #, and the rest lines are
the main data. Each line represents one point, consisting of the x, y, z coordinates, 
and (optional) other data. The program will only load and save x, y, z coordinates and
ignore all the other information.
